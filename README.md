### Running Tests

To execute the tests, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx mocha ./test/registration_test.js
```

### Project Structure

- **`/test/registration_test.js`**: Contains the Mocha test cases for CommerceOS registration.
- **`/support/elements.js`**: Contains element locators used in the tests.
- **`/support/utils.js`**: Utility functions like `clearField` and `generateString`.
- **`/support/pages/registration_page.js`**: Page object for interacting with registration page elements.

### Dependencies

- **`selenium-webdriver`**: JavaScript bindings for Selenium WebDriver.
- **`mocha`**: Test framework for running JavaScript tests.
- **`chai`** (devDependency): Assertion library for test assertions.

### Test Cases

- **Test Case 1: Validate apps for value "fashion"**
  - Opens the registration page for "fashion", fills user information, registers the account, and validates expected apps.

- **Test Case 2: Validate apps for value "santander"**
  - Opens the registration page for "santander", fills user information, registers the account with additional business information, and validates expected apps.
